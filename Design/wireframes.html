            <img src="../Images/Website Homepage.jpg"
                height="300"
                alt="Homepage Wireframe"
                title="Homepage Wireframe">
            <figcaption>Homepage Wireframe</figcaption>     
        </figure>
        <p>I want to have my website simple, and thatâ€™s why most of these initial wireframes will be simple. This homepage will have a header that will have my website's name; under that will be a simple navigation bar that will be easily readable for all users. I want to display any creative I have made, so I want to have it at the forefront and a description. On the side of the page, I want to include thumbnails of other projects for easy exploration.</p>

        <figure>
            <img src="../Images/Website BlogPage.jpg"
                height="300"
                alt="Blog Posts Wireframe"
                title="Blog Posts Wireframe">
            <figcaption>Blog Posts Wireframe</figcaption>     
        </figure>
        <p>As I mentioned, the header and navigation bar are quite simple for the ease of the users. Moving to the blog page, each post will begin with a clear title, followed by the content of the blog. This structured approach enhances readability and engagement, allowing users to effortlessly explore your blog content.</p>
        
        <figure>
            <img src="../Images/Website EssayPage.jpg"
                height="300"
                alt="Essay Page Wireframe"
                title="Essay Page Wireframe">
            <figcaption>Essay Page Wireframe</figcaption>     
        </figure>
        <p>Additionally, the essay page will be divided equally between the two essays, each occupying half of the page's real estate. To prevent overwhelming users with both essays upon page load, their titles will be presented as dropdowns. This approach maintains a clean and organized layout, allowing users to select and focus on the essay of their choice without feeling overloaded with information.</p>
        
        <figure>
            <img src="../Images/Website DesignPage.jpg"
                height="300"
                alt="Design Section Wireframe"
                title="Design Section Wireframe">
            <figcaption>Design Section Wireframe</figcaption>     
        </figure>
        <p>Furthermore, in the Design section, there will be an emphasis on the readability of the page. The visuals, such as wireframe images, will be incorporated alongside explanations detailing the rationale behind design choices. This ensures users can easily understand the thought process behind each concept.</p>

            <img src="../Images/Website PortfolioPage.jpg"
                height="300"
                alt="Portfolio Page Wireframe"
                title="Portfolio Page Wireframe">
            <figcaption>Portfolio Page Wireframe</figcaption>     
        </figure>
        <p>Moreover, the portfolio pages will serve as comprehensive showcases of my creative works. Each work will be accompanied by a descriptive image and a brief overview highlighting its key features. This allows users to quickly browse through my portfolio and gain insight into the range and depth of my creative output.</p>
