                    <p>Spyros Kasapis' article, "Internet Access is a Fundamental Right. Especially, Amidst a Pandemic," dives into the complex world of digital access and how it intersects with issues of inequality and the challenges brought by COVID-19. While I agree that having internet access is crucial for modern life, there's a lot more to it than meets the eye.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Firstly, saying internet access is a fundamental right means acknowledging the many obstacles people face in actually getting online. It's not just about having the infrastructure; there are issues like cost, knowing how to use it, and even cultural barriers that keep some communities from fully engaging online. Just saying it's a right doesn't fix all those problems.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Kasapis also talks about how the pandemic has made economic inequalities worse, especially for people who can't get online. It's not just about being able to shop online; it's also about being shut out of job opportunities and educational resources. Fixing this means more than just giving people internet access; it's about addressing bigger issues like poverty, education, and making sure everyone has the skills they need to thrive online.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>And while governments have a big role to play in making sure everyone can get online, it's not just up to them. We need everyone—governments, businesses, community organizations—to work together to bridge the gap. Only by pooling our resources and ideas can we truly make a difference.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Last, Kasapis touches on the need for rules and regulations to govern the internet. This is important to protect people's privacy and security online, but it's a tricky balance to strike. We need to find a way to protect people without stifling innovation or free speech.</p>
                    <p>In conclusion, making sure everyone can get online is about more than just flipping a switch. It's about addressing the root causes of inequality and working together to build a more equitable digital world.</p>
