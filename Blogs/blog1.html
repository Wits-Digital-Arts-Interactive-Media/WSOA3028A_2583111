                    <p>Setting up GitHub was not an issue as it was needed during the second year of game design, but initially setting it up was a relatively smooth experience as we were guided through the process with a short yet effective video. The repository was also a quick and simple process. However, publishing pages posed challenges. I struggled with locating pages and encountered issues with link loading, leading me to doubt my actions. Despite initial hurdles, persisting through troubleshooting ultimately improved my understanding of GitHub's functionalities and enhanced my proficiency in navigating its features.</p>

                    <p>The reading I had selected was “The Library of Babel, by Jorge Luis Borges (1941)”. The reading delves deeper into the consequences of the infinite and incomprehensible nature of the library of Babel. As pilgrims navigate its labyrinthine corridors, they slowly descend into madness. The search for meaning becomes futile, as even the existence of the Vindications, books that supposedly justify every action, proves elusive; they may not even exist within the library. The library inspires hope and despair in equal measure. While some give up on the prospect of discovering the ultimate knowledge, others give in to nihilism or fanatical destruction. The library of Babel can reflect the internet, as both have an unfathomable and overwhelming wealth of knowledge. Another piece of information I interpreted was the description given of Babel: “The library is a sphere whose exact center is any one of its hexagons and whose circumference is inaccessible”(Borges, 2013), and how it could relate to the shape of the internet, which is often described as a web that wraps around the world, a worldwide web, which would give it a shape similar to that of the library. Another similarity is how many people using the internet could be compared to the pilgrims, as they are searching for information or their "truth,” which can feel like an endless quest fraught with uncertainty and frustration. The library is both unlimited and cyclical; this cyclical nature could be a reference to the cyclical nature of human existence and the enduring quest for meaning and understanding.</p>

                    <p>The iterative nature of the web's development is really fascinating. From its humble beginnings as a smaller Wide Area Information Server (WAIS) client in 1988, to Tim Berners-Lee's concept proposal for the World Wide Web in 1989, to its actual realization on December 25, 1990, the web has continuously evolved and improved upon itself. Its iterative nature highlights the dynamic and adaptive nature of the web, as well as the collective effort of countless individuals and organizations who have contributed to its growth and evolution over the years.</p>

                    <p>My goal for this course is to create accessible, visually appealing, user-friendly, and intuitive websites for all potential users. Creating these effective websites would require having the user experience be simple in demonstrating my intent and objectives to the user, and thus would require time and iteration.</p>
