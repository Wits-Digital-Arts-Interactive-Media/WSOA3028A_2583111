                <p>When looking at “user alignment,” I want to define what I understand it to be first. To me, "user alignment” is how the structure of your website is informed by your target audience. This means understanding the target audience's needs, motivations, and preferences and building your website with those intentions in order to align your goals with what users want to see and do.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>My “User Alignment” goals would focus on readability, so I want my navigation menu to be at the centre of the screen, displaying my knowledge and skills. This means my writings, arts, or designs would be at the centre of the page, as I feel this is readable to most users as it is easily identifiable and should be the first thing they see when they view my page. My users in question are my lecturers or peers at the moment, but in the future, they would be employers. Having the page be readable and easy to navigate would be rather beneficial for that purpose.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>By centring the navigation menu and prioritizing readability, I aim to ensure that users can easily access and explore the content relevant to them. This user-centred approach not only enhances the user experience but also aligns with my overarching goals of showcasing my skills and expertise effectively.</p>
            </li>
               
            
            <li>
                <p>My goal for this course is to create accessible, visually appealing, user-friendly, and intuitive websites for all potential users. Creating these effective websites would require having the user experience be simple in demonstrating my intent and objectives to the user, and thus would require time and iteration.</p>
