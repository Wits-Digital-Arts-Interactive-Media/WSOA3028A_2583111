                    <p>When looking at “user alignment,” I want to define what I understand it to be first. To me, "user alignment” is how the structure of your website is informed by your target audience. This means understanding the target audience's needs, motivations, and preferences and building your website with those intentions in order to align your goals with what users want to see and do.</p>
                </li>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 20px; text-align: left;">
                    <p>My “User Alignment” goals would focus on readability, so I want my navigation menu to be at the centre of the screen, displaying my knowledge and skills. This means my writings, arts, or designs would be at the centre of the page, as I feel this is readable to most users as it is easily identifiable and should be the first thing they see when they view my page. My users in question are my lecturers or peers at the moment, but in the future, they would be employers. Having the page be readable and easy to navigate would be rather beneficial for that purpose.</p>
                </li>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 20px; text-align: left;">
                    <p>By centring the navigation menu and prioritizing readability, I aim to ensure that users can easily access and explore the content relevant to them. This user-centred approach not only enhances the user experience but also aligns with my overarching goals of showcasing my skills and expertise effectively.</p>

                    <p>The arrows I believe is how the user will navigate through my website. They will start at the homepage then move the blog posts to find out about my ideas and weekly thoughts on the lecture materials or move to the portfolio to see my work or what I am currently working on or move to the contacts page to find out more about me, as I believe these are the more important and interesting pages and after navigating those I believe they look at the Essay or Design pages as  I feel these are less interesting then the former.</p>
                </li>
                <figure style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
                    <img src="../Images/Experience of content.png"
                        height="450"
                        alt="User Experience"
                        title="User Experience">
                    <figcaption>This is the User Experience</figcaption>

                <li style="margin-bottom: 20px; text-align: left;">
                    <p>This exercise helped me understand the flow of my site and how to make it more accessible for my users. By mapping out the structure and URL scheme, I gained insights into how users will navigate through the content and access different sections of the website. This understanding allowed me to organize the information in a logical and intuitive manner, ensuring that users can easily find what they are looking for. Additionally, considering semantic markup reinforced the importance of providing meaningful and descriptive tags to content elements. This not only improves search engine optimization but also enhances accessibility for users with disabilities who rely on screen readers. Implementing semantic markup ensures that content is properly interpreted by both humans and machines, leading to a more cohesive and user-friendly browsing experience. Overall, reflecting on the structure, URL scheme, and semantic markup of my website has empowered me to create a more user-centric design that prioritizes accessibility and usability.</p>
