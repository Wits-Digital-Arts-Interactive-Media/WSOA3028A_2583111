                    <h2>Pros</h2>
                    <p>Takealot offers a wide range of products.

                    <h2>Cons</h2>
                    <p>While Takealot's homepage boasts a plethora of promotions, advertisements, and deals, some users might find it a tad overwhelming at first glance. All this clutter may make it difficult for first-time users to understand how to navigate it and may dissuade some users away from the website.</p>

                    <p>eBay is a global online marketplace where users can buy and sell a vast array of goods.</p>
                    <h2>Pros</h2>
                    <p>With eBay's vast international user base, you're not just shopping locally; you're tapping into a global marketplace right from the comfort of your own home. It does not geographically redirect users from using their website.</p>
                    <h2>Cons</h2>
                    <p>While the eBay app offers extensive functionality, its interface can be overwhelming for new users, potentially hindering the onboarding process. The sheer number of features and options available can lead to confusion, making it difficult for users to navigate and utilize the platform effectively. Simplifying the interface or providing more guided tutorials during the onboarding phase could greatly improve the user experience and encourage greater adoption of the app.</p>
