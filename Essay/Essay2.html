                <h3>The Effects of Digital Colonialism in the Tech Industry</h3>
                <p>The rapid growth and dissemination of technology from developed countries to developing ones reveals significant issues not just in the distribution of these technological benefits but also in the very creation and development processes. This technological flow often embeds and perpetuates ideas and biases primarily rooted in the perspectives of the Global North, leading to a form of modern colonialism. These biases shape the knowledge and representations embedded in technology, marginalizing diverse viewpoints and reinforcing power dynamics that are comparable to those of historical colonialism. As a result, the technology developed predominantly in the Global North carries inherent biases and assumptions, which can lead to the exclusion and misrepresentation of the Global South, thereby perpetuating inequalities on a global scale and forming digital colonialism. Google's recent announcement to lay off hundreds of employees from its "core" teams and relocate those roles to India and Mexico emphasizes a broader problematic trend in the tech industry: the perpetuation of digital colonialism. Using Sareeta Amrute's 'Tech Colonialism Today' as a framework to critically examine these power dynamics and ethical considerations of such corporate strategies, as well as to explore the larger global shockwaves of implications of these practices, particularly how these issues affect us as developers in South Africa.</p>
                <p>I have mentioned the idea of digital colonialism, but what is it? To frame it as per the reading, digital colonialism refers to how the development of technological advancements manifests issues of power and control. Technology companies, often concentrated in Silicon Valley, reinforce colonial power dynamics within relationships between people, land, and the social and technical world. This relationship is highlighted in the reading: "A colonial relationship is: hierarchical, extractive, and exploitative." (Sareeta, 2020). One idea highlighted is that these mega-corporations and companies spread an ideology of superiority known as techno-chauvinism, whereby a homogenous group of individuals believes they are uniquely qualified to deploy algorithmic solutions to manage human life. This relationship includes the exploitation of labour and resources in the Global South by tech giants headquartered in the Global North. In the context of Google's layoffs and relocations, digital colonialism manifests through hierarchical, extractive, and exploitative practices that focus on the best interests of the company, maintaining control and profit for the Global North at the expense of individuals.</p>
                <p>The hierarchical nature of digital colonialism is evident in how global tech corporations organize their operations. These companies maintain a top-down approach where key decision-making roles and high-value positions remain concentrated in the Global North, while lower-value operational roles are outsourced to the Global South. This hierarchy ensures that economic benefits and intellectual property remain with the parent company, perpetuating a power imbalance that stifles the potential for local innovation and leadership in the Global South.</p>
                <p>Google's decision to relocate roles to India and Mexico exemplifies this hierarchical structure. While operational roles are being outsourced, core strategic planning and functions remain centralized in the United States to align with the company's goals. Google's statement, “In order to optimize for our business goals, we are expanding work to other locations, which will result in some role eliminations and proposed role eliminations,” (Jennifer, 2024) reflects a business strategy that prioritizes efficiency and cost-effectiveness. From an outside perspective, this strategy appears to prioritize the company's broader objectives while neglecting and walking over the well-being of individual employees.</p>
                <p>This hierarchical approach not only limits career advancement opportunities for workers in the outsourced regions but also keeps these regions economically dependent on the Global North. By retaining higher-value roles in the United States, Google ensures that economic benefits and intellectual property remain centralized. This perpetuates inequalities and diminishes the potential for local innovation.</p>
                <p>Extractive practices in digital colonialism refer to the extraction of labour and resources from regions outside of the Global North without equitable compensation or reinvestment into these developing regions. This mirrors historical colonialism, wherein colonies were exploited for their natural resources and labour to benefit the colonizers with no compensation in return. In the tech industry, this extraction is seen in the outsourcing of jobs to regions with cheaper labour costs, effectively leveraging economic disparities to maximize corporate profits.</p>
                <p>The outsourcing of technical roles to countries like India and Mexico is primarily driven by the pursuit of cost efficiency. By focusing on cost-cutting, tech companies can maximize their profits while providing minimal benefits to the outsourced regions. This approach not only perpetuates economic imbalances but also hinders the development of local tech ecosystems. Workers in these developing regions are often paid significantly less than their counterparts in the Global North, despite performing similar tasks. This wage disparity underlines the extractive nature of these practices, where the primary goal is to extract eligible workers from these regions in order to minimize costs rather than foster sustainable development and fair compensation for all workers involved.</p>
                <p>Another way of resource extraction in digital colonialism is 'data extraction.' As highlighted in the article, “Google plans to build teams closer to users in key markets, including India and Brazil, where labour is cheaper than in the U.S.” (Jennifer, 2024), exemplifies this practice. While the use of cheap labour is inherently exploitative, the decision to create teams in regions where a significant portion of their users reside also facilitates more effective data extraction from those users. By situating teams in these markets, Google can gather and analyse user data more efficiently, leveraging local insights to refine their products and services. This strategy not only maximizes the company's ability to collect valuable data but also amplifies the economic disparity between the Global North and Global South. The data extracted from these regions often fuels innovation and profit for the parent company, without equitable returns to these communities.</p>
                <p>In this way, data extraction parallels the traditional forms of resource extraction seen in historical colonialism. Just as natural resources were extracted from colonies to benefit the colonizers, user data is harvested from developing regions to benefit tech giants headquartered in the Global North. This reinforces a cycle of dependency and exploitation, where the primary goal is to maximize corporate benefits rather than promote sustainable development and fair compensation.</p>
                <p>Exploitative practices are inherent in the way global tech companies treat their outsourced labour. These practices often involve precarious and unsafe employment conditions, limited job security, and minimal career advancement opportunities for workers in developing regions. The emphasis on cost-cutting and efficiency frequently leads to a disregard for the well-being and professional growth of these workers, treating them as disposable assets rather than valuable contributors or, at the very least, human beings.</p>
                <p>Google's layoffs and the subsequent hiring of cheaper labour in India and Mexico illustrate this exploitation. This situation is particularly striking when contrasted with the company's financial success, as highlighted in the article's opening: "Just ahead of its blowout first-quarter earnings report on April 25." (Jennifer, 2024). Despite reporting exceptionally positive financial results, Google chose to lay off employees to further cut costs. The company's statement, "A number of our teams made changes to become more efficient and work better, remove layers, and align their resources to their biggest product priorities" (Jennifer, 2024), is hard to read as it suggests that team members were forced to lay off their own peers. These peers that were laid off seem to just be denoted as 'layers', removing their individuality, making this difficult to digest.</p>
                <p>While the company benefits from reduced labour costs, workers in these developing regions face uncertain job prospects and are often subjected to rigorous performance demands without corresponding benefits. This exploitation perpetuates a cycle of inequality and pushes back the overall development of the tech industry in the Global South. By prioritizing cost efficiency over the fair treatment of employees, tech giants like Google reinforce economic disparities and limit opportunities for local innovation and growth.</p>
                <p>Google's decision to relocate roles to India and Mexico demonstrates the deeply uneven consequences of corporate strategies in the tech industry. While framed as optimization and advancements for business goals, the reality is that it disproportionately burdens workers in these outsourced regions. Workers in developing regions face severe consequences, often landing in low-paying, unstable positions with limited career prospects for their future. This intensifies economic dependency and suppresses local growth. Moreover, the concentration of high-value roles and intellectual property in the Global North further entrenches inequalities, hindering the development of local tech ecosystems. Google's actions exemplify a form of malevolent paternalism, veiled under the guise of efficiency. The use of euphemisms like "role eliminations" obscures the human cost of corporate decisions, reducing affected individuals to mere statistics. By prioritizing profit over people and disregarding the agency of workers in outsourced regions, Google perpetuates a cycle of dependency and exploitation, reinforcing power imbalances in the global tech industry.</p>
                <p>Another manifestation of digital colonialism emerges in the recent issues with Google's AI tool, Gemini, which adds a new layer to the discussion that seems to be the inverse of these issues in an effort to mitigate them. Gemini's problematic outputs, including misinformation, historical inaccuracies, and overly politically correct responses, have sparked significant controversy, dubbing the tool the 'woke' AI, leading to what can be described as a culture war online. Gemini is essentially Google's version of ChatGPT; it can answer questions in text form and generate pictures in response to text prompts. However, there has been recent incidents that have exposed flaws and biases in its data. An instance is when Gemini had inaccurately depicted the US Founding Fathers as people of colour. These issues stem from the vast and biased data sets used to train these AI models and algorithms, these often reflect the prejudices and imbalances of their sources.</p>

                </figure>

                <p>The AI's errors, such as generating historically inaccurate images or providing controversial responses, highlight the limitations of relying solely on algorithmic solutions to address deep-seated biases in the data. There were alarming issues such as the statement “Gemini replied that there was "no right or wrong answer" to a question about whether Elon Musk posting memes on X was worse than Hitler killing millions of people.” (Kleinman, 2024) which seems like an incredibly concerning oversight in the data. Google's attempts to correct these biases resulted in new forms of absurdity, demonstrating that technological fixes alone cannot resolve the nuanced challenges posed by historical and cultural complexities.</p>
                <p>In the context of digital colonialism, Gemini's problems illustrate the hierarchical nature of technology development, where AI tools created in the Global North impose a skewed worldview that marginalizes groups in the Global South. The extractive practices of training AI models on vast amounts of biased data reflect how these technologies exploit cultural narratives without equitable representation or compensation. This is further compounded by the exploitative nature of deploying such AI systems globally, as they perpetuate ethical oversights and cultural misrepresentations that reinforce existing power imbalances. In order to address these issues, Google must acknowledge and rectify the biases ingrained in Gemini's training data, recognizing the inherent challenges of developing AI systems that accurately reflect diverse perspectives and histories. Despite Google's efforts to mitigate these biases, Gemini's outputs highlight the ongoing need for scrutiny and improvement in AI development. Moving forward, it is imperative for tech companies to prioritize diversity, equity, and inclusion in their AI development processes to avoid perpetuating harmful biases and cultural misrepresentations.</p>
                <p>There have been a large number of layoffs in the digital sphere, from Google laying off around two hundred people to Microsoft laying off 1,900 workers at Activision Blizzard and Xbox after its acquisition of them, to Riot Games laying off 530 employees. All of these affect the global dynamics of developers. The article "The Software Developer Shortage and What We Can Do About It," written in 2023, highlights a global shortage of skilled developers: The developer talent gap in the tech industry is very real," (Smith, 2023) ,driven by the increasing complexity of custom software engineering and the growing demand for technical talent. This shortage has significant implications, such as rising costs and delays in software projects, which can ultimately impact global economic competition and innovation. In contrast, the article "Demand for SA Software Developers Slows Amid Global Tech Layoffs," written this year, highlights a significant shift in IT hiring trends, noting a decrease in demand for software developers in South Africa due to global tech layoffs: "Large tech job cuts in the IT sector across the world in 2022 and 2023 led to a decrease in labour demand for South African IT employees. As a result, the most in-demand job sectors list shows demand for IT roles dropped from first ranking in 2021 to third ranking in 2023." (Malinga, 2024). Despite the reduced demand, South Africa continues to face a shortage of various tech skills, exacerbated by digital colonialism, which diverts resources and opportunities away from local talent. This comparison highlights how the global dynamics of digital colonialism and tech talent shortages uniquely impact different regions, particularly emphasizing the challenges faced by the South African software development industry.</p>
                <p>As a developer in South Africa, I am still unsure of my place, but I am aware that recognizing and addressing the impacts of digital colonialism is crucial. My role in these issues should be to advocate for equitable labour practices and support initiatives that prioritize local talent and innovation. This means actively engaging with community-driven projects and cooperatives that promote fair governance and profit-sharing, similar to the models highlighted by Sareeta Amrute.</p>
                <p>In conclusion, digital colonialism perpetuates historical power imbalances by centralizing technological benefits and decision-making in the Global North while exploiting the Global South for labour and data. The hierarchical, extractive, and exploitative practices of tech giants like Google highlight the need for equitable labour practices and local innovation support. Addressing these issues requires recognizing the inherent biases in technology development and actively promoting diversity and inclusion in AI systems.</p>
